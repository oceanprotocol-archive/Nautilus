# Research Work 

```
name: repository of research work what we are interested.
type: research
status: updated draft
editor: Ocean Protocol Team
```

## Introduction

Research work includes **investigation**, **proof-of-concept (PoC)** and **Implementation** of various topics that are interesting to Ocean, which will be transferred to production in a later stage.

This repository maintains on-going research work and will be updated frequently over the time. 

***Disclaimer*** this repository is missing a code audit and should still be considered to be PoC all the time. We can't rule out that there are bugs that might cause loss.
